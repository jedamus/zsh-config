# zsh-config

This is my zsh configuration.

file structure is: ~/.zshrc ~/.myenv ~/.zsh/config ~/.zsh/functions ~/bin/zshprompt.py

The new prompt in zshprompt.py is called when a .git-subdirectory is found.

## Getting started

Perhaps you have to do this first:

```
sudo apt install zsh
```

To install:

```
sh ./install.sh
```
